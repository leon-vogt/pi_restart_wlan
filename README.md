# Check WLan Status

The [checkwlan_script_generator.sh](./checkwlan_script_generator.sh) creates a script that checks if the wlan is connected if not, it will try to reconnect it.
If it could not reconnect for X times, it will reboot the pi.  

The reason why the script is beeing generated, is so the only thing you have to do is uploading the script to the pi and run it.
